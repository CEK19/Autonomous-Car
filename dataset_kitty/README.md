## Cac folder chứa gì

- [x] `data_road`: chứa các hình ảnh và meta data (meta data chưa rõ)
- [ ] `devkit_road`: bộ kit để chạy tự động, đang đọc (đáng sợ quá [đọc tại đây](./devkit/devkit_road/readme.md)).

## Download Policy
To comply with current regulations, all users who download the KITTI dataset must be registered and specify the purpose of dataset usage. If you have no account yet, register below. Note that registration is a two step process. If you are solely interested in downloading the data, you only have to complete the first step. If you want to submit your results, you also need to complete the second step. The second step can be completed at any point in time and must not be completed together with the first step.

## Submission Policy
The provided training data of each challenge may be used for learning the parameters of the algorithms. The test data should be used strictly for reporting the final results compared to competitors on the KITTI website - it must not be used in any way to train or tune systems, for example by evaluating multiple parameter or feature choices and reporting the best results obtained. It is the participants responsability to divide the training set into proper training and validation splits, e.g., using 10-fold cross-validation. The tuned algorithms should then be run only once on the test data.
The evaluation server may not be used for parameter tuning. We ask each participant to upload the final results of their algorithm/paper submission only once to the server and perform all other experiments on the training set. If participants would like to report results in their papers for multiple versions of their algorithm (e.g., parameters or features), this must be done on the training data and only the best performing setting of the novel method may be submitted for evaluation to our server. If comparisons to baselines from third parties (which have not been evaluated on the benchmark website) are desired, please contact us for a discussion.
Important note: It is NOT allowed to register multiple times to the server using different email addresses. We are actively monitoring submissions and we will exclude domains in case this policy is violated. When registering, we ask all participants to provide their full name, institution and institutional email address (e.g., .edu).
KITTI supports open research leading to novel insights and driving forward the community. We only allow submissions that differ significantly from prior art / prior submissions and that have the potential to be published as a separate peer-reviewed paper. Student research projects or small modifications of existing work are not allowed to be submitted. Such work needs to be evaluated on the training set. Every 2 months we delete all entries that are older than 6 months and that are either anonymous or do not have a paper linked. If your review process takes longer you have to resubmit your method after your paper has been accepted.
